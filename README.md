## Usage

Warning: `Makefile` is configured for `Linux` use only.

> - Compile with `make`
> - Run the server with `./server`, then copy the PID
> - Open an additional terminal window and run the client with `./client` + `PID` + `your message`

## Restrictions

This project is written in C and 42 norm compliant:

> - All variables have to be declared and aligned at the top of each function
> - One function cannot have more than 25 lines
> - One file cannot have more than 5 functions
> - It is considering cheating to use functions that are forbidden in the subject
